Notes:
 - Strong tendency to sort.
 - Lots of temporary files, some challenges with naming, tracking, rewriting, etc.
 - Some notable repeated code that should probably be broken out into subroutines.
 - Lots of filename construction.  I want to replace probably all of it.
 - Not enough comments.  Some of desire for more comments comes from lack of 
   understanding of the underlying concepts, but I don't think all of it does.
 - Consider the option of using sqlite?  Probably contraindicated w/r/t usability
   and debugability for the author, but might have some efficiency gains.
